# entree-plat-dessert
Stable marriages implementation done for the HAI904I course of the University of Montpellier by 4 students (master's degree).

# Interface
We use Tkinter to create a graphic interface for our tool. More specifically, we use the [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) python library.
To make this interface work on any desktop platform you first need to install **CustomTkinter** and **packaging** in case you don't have it.
```
pip3 install customtkinter
pip3 install packaging
```
